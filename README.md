Purpose of your application: 

Supervisor Task Tracker -: Currently there is an hourly checklist that should be followed by every supervisor on shift at the Georgian athletics department to ensure the health and safety of the facility. As this is a checklist on a sheet, supervisors forget to follow this on a timely basis. Through this task tracker, the supervisors will get notifications when to do a specific task, and after completing the task supervisors can check it and automatically records the time and supervisor name (with anyb issues or updates) into the database.

Why will this application be useful?  
 
This will reduce the hassle of printing checklist task every day and storing them in binders, and most importantly the risk of misplacing sheets as these are important documents for the monthly inspection done by the Ministry of Health - Ontario. And this is a great step on moving Georgian College Departments towards ‘Going Green’ concept by using simple technology on everyday tasks.
